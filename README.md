# Advanced Data Analysis Techniques for Air Pollution - A Case Study for Italy

This repository contains code and data related to the analysis of air pollution in Italy using the Prophet model as well as Regression Models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Regression and an Ensemble for all Three models) on four major pollutants (NO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10).

# Contents
- Analysis Notebooks:
1. Regression Models
- Regression Models - NO2.ipynb: Includes three Regression models and an ensemble model for NO2.
- Regression Models - O3.ipynb: Contains three Regression models and an ensemble model for O3.
- Regression Models - PM10.ipynb: Consists of three Regression models and an ensemble model for PM10.
- Regression Models - PM25.ipynb: Contains three Regression models and an ensemble model for PM2.5.

2. Time Series Model
- Time series model-Prophet - Lombardy.ipynb: Contains Prophet Model code for each pollutant.

3. Additional Analysis:
- Descriptive and Inferential Statistics.ipynb: Code for dataset description, T-Test, and Correlation analysis.
- Extract Provinces or Region.ipynb: Code to extract data specifically for the Lombardy Province.

4. Supporting Files:
- environment.txt: Lists necessary Python packages.
- /prophet_lombardia: Directory containing Prophet model results (Plots) for each pollutant.
